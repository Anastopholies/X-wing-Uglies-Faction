# X-wing-Uglies-Faction
### This is a entirely new faction for the X-Wing miniatures game that I have been working on for over a year.
New Ships, Dials, Models, and Card images.

This is a janky, ridiculous, and super casual faction.  If you want super powerful ships and pilots, you may want to look elsewhere.  But if you like playing the game to just have fun then this is for you!

The identity of this faction are as follows: (with some exceptions)
1. To be fun, NOT necessarily good.
2. For every upside there is a downside.
4. To stand out as a separate faction, not to feel like any other.
